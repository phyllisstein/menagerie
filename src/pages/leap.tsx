          Ocasio-Cortez, like so many other people of color in her generation,
          had been seduced by the promise that higher education would open up
          opportunities.

          But life out of college was a shock, as it was for millions of other
          millennials entering the postrecession job market. Her father, Sergio,
          who had died when she was a sophomore at Boston University, had told
          her she was special, destined for greatness, capable through
          intelligence and grit of attaining her dreams, and her education had
          reinforced that notion. But upon graduating in 2011, she saw that it
          didn’t matter how smart she was, what she knew, how ambitious or
          imaginative her ideas were. It didn’t matter that she’d won science
          prizes; been chosen to give speeches; immersed herself in economics,
          music, and literature; and graduated cum laude. Sandy, as she was
          sometimes known back then, was a petite young Puerto Rican woman with
          bills to pay. She moved into an apartment in the Parkchester
          development in the Bronx that had belonged to her father, with $25,000
          in student loans and no health insurance. Up in Yorktown Heights in
          Westchester, her family relied on food stamps.

          “Alex, I think, had a Mary Poppins understanding that you follow a
          particular pathway, and bingo! You’re successful,” says Ernesto Nieto,
          a co-founder of the NHI. When she foundered, she felt she was to
          blame. Facing the disparity between how she saw herself and how the
          world saw her “was not very pleasant,” Nieto adds. “That’s the journey
          for a lot of Latinos. The same doors are not there for us as for
          somebody else.”
        </BodyP>
        <BodyP>
          On long car rides to NHI events, Ocasio-Cortez and Nieto swapped
          stories of losing loved ones at a young age, of living between the
          city and the suburbs, of shouldering the responsibility of caring for
          family. Nieto tried to frame Ocasio-Cortez’s struggles as systemic,
          not owing to any shortcoming on her part. Only recent college
          graduates with family support could afford to gild their résumés with
          high-prestige, low-paying internships or to take the financial risk of
          starting a business. In the car, unburdening themselves to each other,
          Ocasio-Cortez and her mentor would cry.

          Life’s auspicious moments are often only evident in retrospect.
          Ocasio-Cortez was likely in the midst of something else when she heard
          from Gabriel. Was she interested in running for Congress? “I mean,
          it’s one of those things where it was like, ‘Eff it. Sure.
          Whatever,’ ” she has said.

          From his car, Gabriel filled out the web form and hit SEND.

          At Coffee Shop — as well as its sister location next door, the
          taqueria Flats Fix — Ocasio-Cortez found herself, once again, at the
          center of a scrappy group of millennial outsiders. Founded in 1990,
          Coffee Shop was a model joint in its heyday. Owned by models, staffed
          by models, patronized by models, it had the after-hours feel of a
          high-tone speakeasy. “The revolving door of people that came through
          there was insane,” remembers Jesse Korman, a photographer who often
          took work meetings at the restaurant and was dating one of the
          bartenders. “Artists and high-end celebrities and crazy tech
          entrepreneurs and music-industry people and normal people.” Speakers
          mounted behind the bar played Brazilian music and indie rock. By the
          time Ocasio-Cortez worked there, its flash had faded, but it retained
          the flavor of a hot spot.
        </BodyP>
        <BodyP>
          The staff understood that beauty was a prerequisite for employment.
          Waiters and bartenders were often hired by the owner, former model
          Carolyn Benitez, who appeared to conduct job interviews like casting
          calls. “She’d say, ‘Come on and sit in the booth,’ and she looks you
          up and down,” remembers Maria Swisher, who worked with Ocasio-Cortez
          behind the bar. “She asked me how to make these two trashy cocktails
          that you really don’t need to know how to make in order to be a
          bartender. A Slippery Nipple, or something. And I was like, ‘I don’t
          know, I can make you an old-fashioned.’ ” Bartenders were expected to
          look hot at work. “I think it even said in our manual we were supposed
          to look fashionable,” Swisher says, “and it was always very unclear
          what that was supposed to mean.” Ocasio-Cortez, sometimes wearing red
          lipstick, her hair up in a messy bun, “probably dressed the most
          conservatively.”

          The front-of-house crew at the restaurant was an assortment of
          creative, idiosyncratic anti-authority types familiar to anyone who
          has ever been young in New York. Swisher was doing political theater;
          another bartender was a performance artist launching a fashion line; a
          third was a sailing instructor and tarot-card reader. “It was this
          free-spirited thing — Hey, we’re in New York City figuring things
          out,” Korman, the photographer and patron, recalls. The Coffee Shop
          girls, as he called them, were always high-energy, operating at a ten
          and yelling at one another across the room.

          Restaurant work has always been a temporary solution for people who
          are between things or hard up. Ocasio-Cortez has since spoken of the
          very exploitative nature of this work, the undocumented old men
          washing dishes in the kitchen, the front-of-house staff working mainly
          for tips, without protections or benefits or scheduled breaks. She
          translates this experience into an equity fable of how, for some, bad
          luck can lead straight to financial calamity, forcing a person to hold
          down a demanding, demeaning job to keep from drowning, while business
          and government perpetuate the notion that misfortune is somehow the
          sufferer’s fault. But this was personal for her. At the restaurant,
          “so many of the people that I worked with had parents that passed
          away, or they were born in circumstances that led to these outcomes,”
          she said. “Whereas in society we’re taught you’re there because that
          is what you deserve. You didn’t work hard enough. You didn’t educate
          yourself enough. You had messed up in some way.”

            While Ocasio-Cortez was trying to get unstuck, the world was
            changing. In 2011, the year she graduated, hundreds of young people
            set up an encampment in Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan. Calling
            themselves “Occupy Wall Street,” they were protesting, among other
            things, growing wealth inequality and the outsize influence of money
            in politics. They introduced the phrase “one percent” to the
            vernacular, a tag that better illustrated a grim social reality than
            any economist’s chart or graph. (They also advocated for canceling
            student debt and raising the minimum wage.) By 2014, when
            Ocasio-Cortez was waitressing and bartending downtown, college
            graduates carried, on average, $28,400 in student debt, and
            unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 was higher than 15 percent.
            That same year, 400,000 people took to the streets of New York to
            protest government and business inaction on climate change, and
            Michael Brown was shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri, leading to
            months of furious uprisings and the growing importance and
            visibility of Black Lives Matter. In 2015, a year before the
            election of Donald Trump, the phrase “downwardly mobile millennial”
            began appearing in the mainstream press. The tectonic plates of
            American politics were shifting, but very few inhabiting the
            established realms of media or government — not the New York Times
            or Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama — could see it yet.

          In 2016, Ocasio-Cortez messaged an acquaintance from her BU days named
          Claire Wasserman, who was running empowerment seminars for women. She
          wanted to attend one called “Get Unstuck,” about how to make
          professional pivots. “She was really unhappy working at the bar,”
          Wasserman remembers. “I was shocked that she was struggling.”
        </BodyP>
        <BodyP>
          But while she was stalled professionally, Ocasio-Cortez was also just
          living her life, working constantly, hanging out with the restaurant
          people and friends from Boston University. After work, the Coffee Shop
          crew often went to a bar nearby, a small, dark place where everyone
          knew the bartender. Ocasio-Cortez was never a partyer, but like so
          many New Yorkers, she loved the adrenalized adventure of exploring
          undiscovered corners of the city. There was a kava bar on 10th Street
          that she and Swisher would visit; her friend Eric Baker remembers once
          meeting her at a hookah lounge after work. “I don’t know if she had
          any fun, but I had a lot of fun watching her try hookah,” he recalled.
          Ocasio-Cortez was clearly at a crossroads in life, “just turning over
          how she was going to move forward,” Baker said. Though Ocasio-Cortez
          and her boyfriend Riley Roberts had split up near the end of college
          after dating for much of their senior year, they were back together,
          working it out and doing a long-distance thing — he was in Arizona
          helping start-ups with digital marketing and planning to move to New
          York — and when he was around, he would join the group after hours,
          talking about websites and music and tech.
